# Project: Embedding Images and Video

See the live version of the project [here](https://ubercj.github.io/youtube_video_page/).

This is a project from The Odin Project's HTML/CSS section in which I'm supposed to create a mock version of [this page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V74l_zS1x8E). It isn't necessary to copy any of the functional elements that require Javascript - the goal is just to copy the layout and media embedding to brush up on HTML and CSS skills.
